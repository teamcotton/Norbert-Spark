# Shared Package Testing

This package includes unit tests that run in both Node.js and browser (jsdom) environments to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## Test Structure

Tests are located in the `tests/` directory and mirror the structure of the `src/` directory:

```
tests/
├── guards/
│   └── type.guards.test.ts
└── schemas/
    └── auth.test.ts
```

## Running Tests

### Run all tests (both environments)

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Run tests in Node.js environment only

```bash
pnpm run test:node
```

### Run tests in browser (jsdom) environment only

```bash
pnpm run test:browser
```

### Run tests in watch mode

```bash
pnpm run test:watch
```

### Run tests with coverage

```bash
pnpm run test:coverage
```

## Test Configurations

- **Node Environment**: `vitest.config.node.ts` - Tests run in Node.js environment
- **Browser Environment**: `vitest.config.browser.ts` - Tests run in jsdom (simulated browser) environment

Both configurations use the same test files, ensuring that the code works correctly in both environments.

## Writing Tests

When writing tests, import directly from the source files using relative paths:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { LoginSchema } from '../../src/schemas/auth.js'

describe('Auth Schemas', () => {
  it('should validate login data', () => {
    const result = LoginSchema.safeParse({
      email: 'test@example.com',
      password: 'password123',
    })
    expect(result.success).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

## Current Test Coverage

- **Type Guards**: 25 tests covering all type guard utilities
- **Auth Schemas**: 9 tests covering LoginSchema and RegisterSchema validation

All tests pass in both Node.js and browser environments.
